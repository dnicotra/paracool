# paracool

paracool is a live GNU\Linux distribution based on Debian that allows to build an MPI cluster over an existing network.

It is in early developing state. No prealpha/alpha/beta version are avaiable in this repository. I'm going to keep this repo updated with my last "working" developing version.
